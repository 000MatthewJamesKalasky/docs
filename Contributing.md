***Any contribution helps our team and makes Tasmota better for the entire community!***

We need:
- tutorials on using Tasmota features that aren't covered yet
- guides on wiring and using sensors supported by Tasmota
- your DIY projects featuring Tasmota
- new device templates 
- fixing spelling mistakes, broken links and other errors in the Wiki

***Please do not edit the sidebar links unless it's a broken link*** 

# Removing information

***Do not remove information about deprecated or discontinued devices.***

The information available is still needed for devices in the field (like Shelly 2) and loss of information makes them unusable in case of debugging or fault analysis.

# Adding devices to the wiki

All new devices should be submitted through the [Templates Repository](http://blakadder.github.io/templates). If you're adding a device with a comprehensive flashing or configuration tutorial you can create a new page in the Wiki and link to it in your template submission.

# Editing the wiki
If you spot an error in an article use the *Edit* function to correct it. Make sure you write a short description on what you've changed in *Edit message* input box before clicking *Save page*.

# Writing guides
Whenever you feel is a good guide or an article that would help other users just click the New Page icon and write.
