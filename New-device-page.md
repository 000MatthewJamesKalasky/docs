This is the required structure for adding a new device to the wiki. Use the _Edit_ button, copy the code below this paragraph then paste it after clicking _New page_. For the page title use only the device name and manufacturers code if available. There are too many mushroom brands that simply rebrand a single product. If you want to add a similar one expand the existing device page.
____________

***Supported since version 6.5 (change version number only for supported modules)***

This is where you enter a short desription of the device: features, which electrical standard it is compatible with, etc. *Keep it short and informative, no need for a wall of text*.

[Manufacturer Link](New-device-page) - this is where you enter a link to the manufacturer page (or seller page)

[Compatible devices](New-device-page) - add any device with a different name that is compatible with this one

## Procedure
Add a flashing guide, preferably in steps, especially if there is a special procedure to put the device into flashing mode. Images optional but desired. If you have a video, link it!

If you used OTA flash, link to which program you used. 

# Miscellaneous
Any information not related to the above: optional settings, home automation hub configurations you used, observations about the device, links to external sources. The sky is the limit.
