The original ESP32 port is here:
[**JacekDob/Sonoff-Tasmota**](https://github.com/JacekDob/Sonoff-Tasmota)

Because tasmota seems to have broken github's network page, it's very difficult to find forks now.  So if you have a significant fork of JacekDob, note it here if you think it will be useful.

e.g. 

[**btsimonh/Sonoff-Tasmota**](https://github.com/btsimonh/Sonoff-Tasmota/tree/esp32-dev-firsttest) - branch builds in platform.io on 2018-11-04
